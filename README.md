JavaScript Koans is an interactive learning environment that uses failing tests to introduce students to aspects of JavaScript in a logical sequence. These problems will be very simple, so don't overthink them! In most cases the solution is in the question itself. This is about practice and exposure. This should be practiced regularly, in fact you will given this assignment a number of times.

## Running the koans

First, fork and clone [the repository](https://github.com/tiy-tpa-fee/koans) from your own account, if needed.

```sh
yarn install
yarn reset
yarn test
```

Start editing `koans.js`. You only need replace instances of `__` in each test case to make it pass. You shouldn't need to edit any other code.
